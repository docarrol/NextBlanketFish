  <descr>[Proxy] asks Todd about the body appearance module.

- Actually, this module is pretty easy. In fact I already have a working version of it installed on the scanner, you might&apos;ve noticed that. Anywho, with the modification of the apperance such as hair and eye color, I can actually change the DNA itself! This means you can determine how exactly your child will look, if your gene is dominant enough.

- However, to achieve this I&apos;m going to need a scan of every possible hair and eye color. This is a lot of work and I&apos;m not going to blame you for not participating in this. If you would rather do another upgrade or modification, let me know.
