  <descr>After wandering for a bit, [Proxy] finds a door that is not completely closed leading to a rather large lab. Curiosity getting the better of [himher], [she] looks through the open doorway and sees a woman in a doctor&apos;s robe working on something. Before [proxy] can duck out of sight, the woman inside the room notices [proxy], stops what she is working on, and smiles at [himher].

- Hello. I am doctor Andrea Felis. Are you lost or looking for something?

[Proxy] blushes and stammers that [heshe] got lost and apologizes for interrupting her work. As [heshe] turns to leave, Dr. Felis asks [himher] to wait.
