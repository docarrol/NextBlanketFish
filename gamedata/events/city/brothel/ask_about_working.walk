  <descr>[Proxy] asks about the possibility of working here as a... fun provider. Neferi looks at [her] thoughtfully.&#xd;
&#xd;
- Yes, it&apos;s possible. Clients like variety, so I hire new faces as part time workers pretty often. But there is some rules that you must abide by. First and most importantly, you better not cause any trouble. Second, I pay you only if the client leaves satisfied. And third, you don&apos;t select the clients, I do. Since you&apos;re not a regular employee, you have the privilege of leaving the client at any time without any repercussions. They will be told this as well before they meet you. Though if a client leaves or is left unsatisfied, there will be no payment.&#xd;
