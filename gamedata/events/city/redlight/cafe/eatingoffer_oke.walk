  <descr>[proxy] talks to the manager asking what that offer earlier at Vicky&apos;s place was about.&#xd;
&#xd;
-As you might know, we are a cafe specialized to service customers with some particular tastes. One of our most popular sections is where customers pay to have someone eat for them.&#xd;
&#xd;
[proxy] replies surprised, they pay to have someone eat for them. Why would they ever do that.&#xd;
&#xd;
-for a number of reasons really. Some woman like to feed someone else everything they cannot eat because of their line or their diet. For them it is a good way to blow off steam. Other like to see someone’s belly and eventually their waste grow because of their work. I do not really care about the reason but they pay good money. From what I have seen at Vicky&apos;s you have a good appetite, exactly what my customers require. I am willing to pay your for eating, that sounds like a good deal. The more you eat the more the pay.&#xd;
