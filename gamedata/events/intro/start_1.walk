  <descr>...The last thing you remember is going to the market, happily daydreaming as you walked along. All of a sudden there was a bright flash, accompanied by a loud sound, and your world faded to black. Now, you are starting to recall a few fragments of what happened after the accident.

-Sir, our time is almost up. The body is in terrible condition and vital signs are beginning to fade!

-Shame that I wasn&apos;t able to save this person. We have no choice. Prepare the project now! Hopefully it will work.

-Sir, the head has been damaged as well. Are you sure it&apos;s wise to proceed. There might be complications.

-Yes. We are responsible after all. If only we could do something else... But we have no choice. Now, begin!
