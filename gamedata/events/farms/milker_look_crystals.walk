  <descr>[proxy] inspects the unit. The device is rather complicated - a mechanical pump is attached to a magical engine. As designed by its maker apparatus can be charged by collecting magical energy. Unfortunately the part that is responsible for it is broken. In addition, the apparatus has a receiver for ordinary crystals.
Looking more closely, [proxy] concludes that the problem with the charger is the complex crystal. 

- The crystal from the charger is broken. I was promised a fix for it, but it is unclear if it will work - Belanika says.

It&apos;s possible to find the magic crystals. You could also buy them from a shop, but this can be rather expensive. Either way, ordinary crystals are only a temporary solution.
