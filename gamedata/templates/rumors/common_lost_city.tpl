  <text>[Proxy] hears two men talking:&#xd;
&#xd;
- Lost cities are very interesting, but going inside of them is pretty dangerous. DS not only partially ruined, but also twisted them...&#xd;
- I heard that monsters are living inside them now. Is it true?&#xd;
- In some sense. Almost all of these &quot;monsters&quot; are changed animals and mechanisms. In zones with a high DS activity, some complex items and things can obtain a semblance of life... but are not sentient.&#xd;
