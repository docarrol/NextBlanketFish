  <text>- Anyway, I need to show you how to get to the our village.  From here go to the forest edge. I can usually go through the forest, but I&apos;m a seeth and can feel the right direction. You can&apos;t, so just go by the forest edge to the right. There will be no trail or road, so it can be a little difficult. But it&apos;s still easier than going through forest. I think it will take four or five hours, but eventually you should see an old shrine and road from it. Go on the road and soon you will be in the village. But take this...&#xd;
&#xd;
Kiana give [proxy] small pendant in the form of the leaf and looks directly in [hisher] eyes.&#xd;
&#xd;
- Without it you won&apos;t find the shrine or the road. And please, don&apos;t lose it.&#xd;
