  <text>- Anyway, I need to show you how to get to the our village.  From here go to the forest edge. I usualy can go through forest, but I&apos;m a seeth and can feel right directions. You can&apos;t, so just go by the forest edge to the right. There will be no trail or road, so it can be a little difficult. But it&apos;s still easier than going through forest. I think it will take four or five hours, but eventually you will see a old shrine and road from it. Go on the road and very quickly you will be in the village. But take this...&#xd;
&#xd;
Kiana give [proxy] small pendant in the form of the leaf and look directly in the eyes.&#xd;
&#xd;
- Without it you will do not find shrine and the road. And please, do not lost it.&#xd;
