  <text>Before [proxy] can walk to the exit the manager tells her&#xd;
&#xd;
-You made remarkable process over time and your increasing presents is a witness of that. But it seems to get a bit harder for you to fit in the booths. I am sorry to tell you this but it seems there is starting to get a bit too much you. It seems you gained around &lt;%(Integer)proxy.getStat(&quot;generic.weight&quot;)/1000-(Integer)GetPerFlag(&quot;start.weight&quot;)&quot;&quot;;%&gt; kg while working here. I know some customers really love your change but soon you get too big to work.&#xd;
&#xd;
[proxy] is a bit offended by what the manager is telling her. He is the one paying &lt;%activePartner.HisHer();%&gt; to eat those ridiculous amounts.&#xd;
&#xd;
-I feel a bit responsible for causing this so let me help you. I have a friend who owns a magic shop who also helped me with a previous case. Tell him I sent you and he will surly help you.&#xd;
