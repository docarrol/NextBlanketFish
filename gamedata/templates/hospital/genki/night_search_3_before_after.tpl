  <text>[Proxy] finds Dr. Genki&apos;s office and gives the doorknob a turn, surprised to find that the door opens. Seems he forgot to lock it.&#xd;
&#xd;
Both of you driven by curiosity, [proxy] carefully enters the office and leaves the door ajar. While looking around, [heshe] spies some papers sitting on Dr. Genki&apos;s desk and heads for it to see if it&apos;s anything of interest. Not wanting to disturb the papers, least the doctor figures out that someone was snooping in his office, [proxy] looks at the papers lying on the stack. It seems to be part of a report of a procedure performed by Dr. Genki, as far as you can tell. Attached to it with a paper clip are two photos of a fairly young looking futanari marked &apos;before&apos; and &apos;after&apos;. The differences are pretty impressive...&#xd;
