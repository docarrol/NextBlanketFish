  <text>[proxy] tells Felis that &lt;%activePartner.HeShe();%&gt; found the woman called Olivia and that the rumors where true. Olivia has according to her the normal Tau female production with human sized breasts.&#xd;
&#xd;
-Great, this outcome is even better than expected. So when can you bring her to me for the necessary tests?&#xd;
&#xd;
[proxy] continues to explain that Olivia does not want to leave her forest under any circumstances and Felis cannot visit her without permission of the Shaman.&#xd;
&#xd;
Felis thinks for a bit.&#xd;
&#xd;
-Seeing as what you had to do for the shaman it is highly unlikely I´m ever going to get permission. There seems to be only one solution. It is less than ideal but we have to try it. Try to bring me a decent amount of milk. To run all the tests I need a minimum of 4.5 liters, better bring 9 liters so I can run my experiments at full scale. Let me get you some sterilized containers to transport the milk.&#xd;
